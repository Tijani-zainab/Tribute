# Tribute
# A front-end apreciation design
Tribute is my first project as a beginner on wejapa Internship to show an apprrciation to someone of respect and value.
In my case, i cound not think of a particular person to dedicate this honor to. So i made it 
general as tribute to everyone i love and respect.

## Requirement Omitted
Currently the page is not responsive on mobile,because
I was away from my pc days to submisson. 

## Issues faced
Actually the idea, color and design came easily, but i was overwelm two couple days later when i 
Thought i got that. i have to deploy to netlify. was trying to do it on my phone, and was really worried
I woudnt be able to submit.
But it turns out, my github link was enough.

## Constructive feedback
I showed the first design to a friend, and he
Made me realise i should keep the simplicity and 
and change the background image.

I contrubuted all to it myself, and grateful for
This opportunity ‚ù§
